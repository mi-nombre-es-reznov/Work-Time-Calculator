// Description: This will be a program that will compute times to display how many hours/minutes you worked, with time on/off.

    string name;
    
    // Get name for now, for a more personal experience throughout the program.
    cout << "Please enter your name: ";

    // Testing for name. Delete later.
    cout << "Your name is: " << name << "!" << endl << endl;
    
    // Ask for start hour, 24 hr format.
    
    // Ask for start minute.
    
    // Ask for ending hour, 24 hr format.
    
    // Ask for ending minute.
    
    // Begin loop for breaks. Ask for number of breaks during work day, not to exceed 5. Place in 2 arrays (hr and min).
        // Ask for lunch hour start, 24 hr format.
        
        // Ask for lunch hour end minute.
        
        // Ask for lunch hour end, 24 hr format.
        
        // Ask for lunch minute end, 24 hr format.
    // End loop for breaks.
    
    // Convert all times over to minutes.
    
    // Find range time in minutes of overall work day
    
    // Convert breaks into minutes. Add hr[i] with time[i] together. Place result in mins. in new array.
    
    // Subtract all values of new array (breaks) from total time.
    
    // Convert back to hours and minutes of total working time.
    
    // Output data. Give range (full working day) and then each break (above 0). Below that, give total time worked in hours and minutes.
