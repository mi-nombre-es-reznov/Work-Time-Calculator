# Work Time Calculator
<p>
    Description: <br>
    
    This will be a program that will compute times to display how many 
    hours/minutes you worked, with time on/off. The program will ask the user 
    if for their start and end times, seperating a space between hours and 
    minutes. The prgram will display an option for the user to enter breaks in 
    and have those calculated in the time off from working. Depending on the 
    data that the system holds, only certain information will be displayed, to 
    avoid redundancy.
    
    This program shows the start and end time after the original calculation. 
    The program also displays your break times, with the times you went on 
    break, next to them.
    
    This program will now have the capability to enter times and define them as
    am/pm times. The system will auto correct the numbers to give accurate
    numbers.
    
    Update (26 March 19): The program now will display a.m./p.m. next the
    starting/ending time as well as for every breaks starting/ending time. All
    of the times have been converted from their 24-hr equivalent back to their
    12-hr equivalent with their a.m./p.m. value for displaying.
    
    Update (27 March 19): The program now will allow for the user to pick a time
    increment they want to get a specific time version. Current versions that
    are selectable: 10-min, 15-min, and 20-min.

<h2>General Overview of Program and Screens</h2>

<!-- Demo Overview - Name Request -->
<p>
    When starting the program, a prompt will ask for a name. It 
    doesn't matter if the name that is entered is the users first or full name. 
    The point of this is to make the program feel a little more personal to the
    user at the end during the displayed output.

<!-- Demo Overview - Time Entry Description -->
<p>
Once a name has been input into the program, the next screen will show how to
input a time in the format the program requires. It is okay to enter the hour, 
then enter a minute and press 'enter' again. However, it is more aesthetically 
pleasing to enter both hour and minute on the same line (seperated by a space).
