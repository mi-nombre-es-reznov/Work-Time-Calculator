# Work-Time-Calculator
<p>
    Description: <br><br>
    
    This will be a program that will compute times to display how many 
    hours/minutes you worked, with time on/off. The program will ask the user 
    if for their start and end times, seperating a space between hours and 
    minutes. The prgram will display an option for the user to enter breaks in 
    and have those calculated in the time off from working. Depending on the 
    data that the system holds, only certain information will be displayed, to 
    avoid redundancy.
    
    This program shows the start and end time after the original calculation. 
    The program also displays your break times, with the times you went on 
    break, next to them.
    
    This program will now have the capability to enter times and define them as
    am/pm times. The system will auto correct the numbers to give accurate
    numbers.
